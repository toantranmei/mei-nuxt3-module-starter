A minimal [reproduction is required](https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required) unless you are absolutely sure that the issue is obvious and the provided information is enough to understand the problem. If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "needs reproduction" label. If no reproduction is provided we might close it.
